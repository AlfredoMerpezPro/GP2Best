            <p>Q.  Are the Atari items on your website really in stock?
            A.  Yes, I would say that 98 to 99% of the Atari items listed at our site are in stock.</p>
            <p>Q.  Are the Atari items listed on your website really New, and how can that be some 38 years later?
            A.  Unless otherwise stated (reconditioned, used or loose), all Atari items on our web site are new. We cleared out the 4 to 6 different Atari warehouses over the past 20 years in Sunnyvale California and bought thousands of pallets of new Atari Products.</p>
            <p>Q.  A Friend / Brother / Sister who bought from you in the past recommended I check out your website and buy from youâ€¦ Do you really have all of the Atari items they say you have in stock?
            A.  Yes a good percentage of our Atari business over the last 38+ years has come from customer referrals / recommendations and yes they are really in stock!</p>
            <p>Q.  Do you ship Atari orders to International Countries?
            A.  Yes. We have been shipping orders all over the world for over 30+ years now.</p>
